# logocalendar.win9x

This project is just an example of my old project in old 200x years.

It was written with Borland C++ 3.1

In Windows 95-98 there was a file 'logo.sys' which was a regular BMP file in fact.

This program generates this file with a calendar.

The comments are on Russian in CP866 encoding - I am sorry for this, I did not change it.
